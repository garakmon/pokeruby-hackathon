# Pokémon Ruby Hackathon Template

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Ruby, modified to be suitable for a hackathon.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Littleroot Town and Route 101 have been completely cleared with all their events, flags, and vars removed. The intro truck sequence is removed. Running shoes, National Dex, Pokenav are enabled, and 3 Pokemon are given to the player upon starting a new game.
